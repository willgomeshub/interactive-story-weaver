# Interactive Story Weaver (AI-Powered)

This repository hosts a personal project exploring the exciting intersection of **AI and interactive narrative generation**. The core idea is to build a user-friendly application where users can dive into dynamic stories, shaping the plot through their choices.

Initially, this project focuses on demonstrating the seamless integration of a Generative AI model to:

* **Create initial story prompts and beginnings.**
* **Dynamically expand narratives based on user input.**
* *(Future: Potentially generate accompanying visual elements/illustrations.)*

This serves as a practical playground for:

* **Developing robust backend logic for AI interaction.**
* **Designing an intuitive user interface for narrative engagement.**
* **Experimenting with prompt engineering for varied story outcomes.**

Join me on this journey as I weave code and creativity to bring interactive storytelling to life!
